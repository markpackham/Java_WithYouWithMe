Game ideas

Have gold and manage resources

Mange against random elements - famine or feed knights (farmers), attacks (knights) (combine strength), buildings (more homes, increase population)

Or player is a monster like a dragon, game based around picking fights and risking health Vs damage done to humans with points on damage done
